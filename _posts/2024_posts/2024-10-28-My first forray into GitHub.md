title: "My first forray into GitHub"
date: 2024-10-28
This has been my first experience in GitHub and with anything resembling coding. It has been fairly intuitive once I have got my head round the basics and already have a multitude of different things I want to do with it flying round my head. 
Hopefully, fairly quickly I will be able to increase my skills and be able to move on from basic use to more in depth cases.
